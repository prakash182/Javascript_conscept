console.log("2" > 1);
console.log("2" == 2);
console.log( "2"< 3);
/* in javaScript automatically convert string into number thats why its outcome will be true in all three cases
*/

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null < 0);
console.log(null >= 0);

// same thing happen also here that null treated as 0 that reason its output will be according to 0
